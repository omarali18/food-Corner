            <h1><span class="orenge-color">Global</span> expansion of markets</h1>
            <p>Pizza sales gross about $37 billion annually in the US. While the market in the West may be approaching
                saturation, it is now mushrooming in the far East. It is eaten almost everywhere. Former Premier
                Gorbachev advertised pizza for Pizza Hut at a Moscow restaurant. The Schwan Food Company currently
                exports frozen pizza to Russia. In the expression, “As American as apple pie” it has been suggested that
                “apple” be replaced by “pizza.” There is evidence to support this revision.</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Pizza can be traced back to its origin in the Persian Empire around 500 BC when flat bread was topped
                with cheese and dates. Tomato was added by the Romans (Qarooni et al., 1992). Pizza coated with spices,
                oils and sesame seeds is still popular in the Middle-East (maneesh). Modern pizza is a firmly
                established food in the west, with the crust produced by a sheeting and die-cut procedure, hot or cold
                pressing, or shaping by hand. Dough retardation (where dough is held at refrigerator temperatures) is
                often used in fast-food franchises to enable timely meeting of customer orders.</p>

            <p>Since the moment when Raffaele Esposito made his historic pizza Margherita in 1984, the basic structure
                of pizza became fixed. All the future variation of pizzas has been made with four distinct ingredients
                -the crust, the sauce, cheese and topping.</p>
